# Following and unfollowing

## Following

Following a user is as easy as calling `agent.follow` with the DID of the user you want to follow.

<Tabs groupId="sdk">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript">
    ```typescript title="agent.follow"
      const { uri } = await agent.follow(did)
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

| Parameter | Type     | Description                   | Required |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------------------- | -------- |
| `did`     | `string` | The DID of the user to follow | Yes      |

## Unfollowing 

Unfollowing a user involves deleting the follow record via its URI, returned
from `agent.follow`. This is very similar to what we did when [unliking a
post](/docs/tutorials/like-repost).

<Tabs groupId="sdk">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript">
    ```typescript title="agent.deleteFollow"
      await agent.deleteFollow(uri)
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

| Parameter | Type     | Description                   | Required |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------------------- | -------- |
| `uri`     | `string` | The URI of the follow record to delete | Yes      |
