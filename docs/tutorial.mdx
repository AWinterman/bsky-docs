# Quick Start Tutorial

Let's get started by making your first post to the Bluesky app via the API in under 5 minutes.

## Getting Started

To create a post on Bluesky, you'll need an account. If you don't have an invite code yet, sign up for the waitlist [here](https://forms.gle/PxicYPHmffAVteFV9). 

Have your username and password handy.

:::tip

For your security, use an App Password. You can generate an App Password in Settings > Advanced > App passwords.

App passwords have most of the same abilities as the user's account password, but they're restricted from destructive actions such as account deletion or account migration. They are also restricted from creating additional app passwords.

## Post via the API

### Create a session

This creates an authentication session with your username and password.

Replace `$BLUESKY_HANDLE` and `$BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD` with your credentials.

```bash
curl -X POST https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.server.createSession \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"identifier": "'"$BLUESKY_HANDLE"'", "password": "'"$BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD"'"}'
```

The `com.atproto.server.createSession` API endpoint returns a session object containing two API tokens:
* `accessJwt`: an access token which is used to authenticate requests but expires after a few minutes
* `refreshJwt`: a refresh token which lasts longer and is used only to update the session with a new access token

```json
{
  "did": "did:plc:abc123...",
  "handle": "username.bsky.social",
  "email": "email@example.com",
  "emailConfirmed": true,
  "accessJwt": "xyz...",
  "refreshJwt":"xyz..."
}
```

:::note

The `did` is your persistent, long-term account identifier. Even if your handle changes, your DID will stay the same.

:::
Since we're just publishing a single post, we can get away with a single session and not bother with refreshing.

You can export the `accessJwt` token to an environment variable for use in subsequent requests.

### Create a post 
Now you can create a post by sending a POST request to the createRecord endpoint.

```bash
curl -X POST https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.repo.createRecord \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{\"repo\": \"$BLUESKY_HANDLE\", \"collection\": \"app.bsky.feed.post\", \"record\": {\"text\": \"Hello world! I posted this via the API.\", \"createdAt\": \"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"}}"

```

This will return an object containing the post's URI and [CID](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/#identifier-formats), or content identifier. 

```json
{
  "uri": "at://did:plc:abc123..../app.bsky.feed.post/xyz...",
  "cid": "abc..."
}
```

Check out your profile to see the post you just created!

Alternatively, you can use the URI in the above returned object to find the post on the Bluesky app. The URL will be in this format: 
`https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:abc123..../app.bsky.feed.post/xyz...`

### Next Steps

Posts can get a lot more complicated with replies, mentions, embedding images, and more.
